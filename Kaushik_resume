Work Experience
Project #1 (June 2011 to Feb 2014):
Company	:	HCL Technologies, Chennai, India
Project		:	“Onboard Failure Logging System (OBFL)”
Client		:	CISCO
Designation	:	Software Developer
Technology	:	C, Data Structures, Multi-threading and TCP/IP socket programming
Team Size	:	4
Platform	:	Next Generation 3K Cisco router 
	
Project Description
	  This project is to implement On-board Failure Logging (OBFL) mechanism for applications to store H/W troubleshooting data into non-volatile memories for diagnostic and repairs in Cisco’s NG3k router

Roles and Responsibilities
•	Development of OBFL infrastructure and framework, Development of Multi-threaded applications such as Temperature, Voltage, Poe, Uptime, and Error messages. Implementing OBFL related CLI’s for retrieving/displaying the relevant data to login user
•	Working with Development testing team on fixing bugs during the Initial Development testing phase 

Project #2 (Feb 2014 to June 2014):
Company	:	HCL Technologies, Chennai, India
Project		:	“FUSE Project 
Client		:	CISCO
Designation	:	Senior Software Developer
Technology	:	C, Data Structures
Team Size	:	2
Platform	:	ASR 1K Cisco router 

Project Description
	  FUSE project was developed to support AVFS (Virtual Filesystem) for Cisco’s ASR1K routers. The major requirement is to switch filesystem running in kernel space into running in user’s space. This will enable Cisco’s own filesystem code like DISK, USBFLASH filesystem, which is quite stable and also supports Cisco requirements/features in its routers

Roles and Responsibilities
•	Coding FUSE routines to Compile/build by Makefiles and Upgrade the unit with the new code
•	Review other [India/USA] developer’s code report each week and provide Updates to the Team lead and Project manager

Achievements
•	Member of O-Infiniti league, Awarded Outstanding programmer for two consecutive years 2012, 13 in CODC
•	Participated in 11th International Conference on the Design of Reliable Communication Networks held in Kansas city, 2015
